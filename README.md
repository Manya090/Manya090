git init
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
git add filename
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
git push origin branch_name
git checkout branch_name

If there are conflicts during a merge, you'll need to resolve them.

```bash
# After resolving conflicts, mark them as resolved
git add filename

# Continue with the merge
git merge --continue
```
To see the status of your repository (what's changed, what's staged, etc.):

```bash
git status
```
Create a `.gitignore` file to specify files or patterns you want Git to ignore.

```
# Example .gitignore file
node_modules/
*.log
```
To tag a specific commit, you can use the following command:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0"
```
